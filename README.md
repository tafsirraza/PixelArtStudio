Wecome To Pixel Art Studio

Hey there! Thanks for checking out my Pixel Art Studio project. 

What is This?
Pixel Art Studio is a simple but solid pixel drawing tool you can use right in your browser. You can make your own pixel designs like sprites, icons, game tiles, or just random doodles without needing to set up any software or mess around with complicated stuff. Everything’s built with regular web tech (HTML, CSS, JavaScript), so it runs anywhere you want, on desktop or mobile phones.

What Can You Do With It?
Draw Pixel Art: You get a grid-based canvas that feels like classic retro pixel editors.

Responsive Design: The board, palette, and all the buttons stay centered and fit perfectly on any screen, big or small—no weird scrolling or awkward layouts. Works great on both PC and mobile.

Handy Tools: Use the pen, eraser, fill bucket, or eyedropper to draw and edit however you like.

Palette: Pick from default colors, or add and remove your own custom colors. No limits.

Undo & Redo: Made a mistake? Hit undo. Changed your mind again? Redo is there too.

Save/Load: You can save your pixel art and load it again later it uses your browser’s storage, so you never lose your work by accident.

Export: Download your finished art as a PNG image with just one click.

Keyboard Shortcuts: Quick actions for tools and undo/redo (just like real graphics software).

Polished UI: Everything’s organized, and looks like a proper creative tool.

How Do You Use It?
Pick a color from the palette (or add your own by clicking the + button).

Choose a tool from the toolbar at the top (pen, eraser, fill, eyedropper you get the idea).

Draw on the pixel board. Everything you do updates instantly.

Undo/Redo if you make a mistake.

Save your art and come back to it later, or export it as a PNG and share it wherever you want.

It’s really that easy. You don’t need to sign in, install anything, or learn complicated menus.

Why Did I Build This?
Honestly, I just wanted a project that mixes creativity with coding, something fun but also genuinely useful. Most online editors I found were either too basic or bloated. I wanted something clean, modern, and user friendly that I could actually use and show off a bit. Plus, learning how to make the interface work smoothly across different devices was a great way to pick up practical skills.

What’s Under the Hood?
HTML/CSS/JS: Handwritten and modular, no frameworks or AI-generated shortcuts. Everything you see, I coded myself.

Canvas API: Used for the pixel drawing grid.

Local Storage: Used to save and load your work.

Fully Responsive Layout: No matter what device or window size, the project looks sharp and works comfortably.

Finally I will Say to you that
If you want to play around with pixel art, need a quick tool for game assets, or just want to see what you can make on a grid, give it a try! If you spot any issues or have ideas for features, just let me know.

And just a little personal touch whatever you make, I hope you have as much fun using this as I did making it.
